## Getting started

for good experience
1- delete node-modules
2-in terminal `npm install`

## Setting up the API

I'm using MeaningCloud API 
First, you will need to go [here](https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/sentiment-analysis). Signing up will get you an API key

In the file .env replace my api key with yours

### Deploying

1- npm install

## 2- for dev you need to run two terminals 
1- "npm run build-dev"
2- navigate to src/server and run "npm start"

## 3- for production
